## Agenda



*   Welcome/Intros

*   Select WG leader(s)
*   Align on proposal ( template at https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/master/process/wg_readme_template.md )
*   Next steps and meeting cadence.


## Meeting Notes

Intros - some concerns:



*   OpenEXR images repo = an example of best practices
*   Testing / conformance
*   mentoring / canonical references
    *   Individual assets
    *   Scene structure (USD?)
*   portability of assets
*   repurposing for multiple markets / applications
*   film production quality e.g. Moana Island
*   research; help make research applicable for real world problems
*   no one at studio says no - but no one is authorized / motivated to say yes

Slides from Governing Board 09/22/20



*   Asset repo voted number one idea for ASWF “what else”
*   Community is open to assets for testing only as well as for production use
*   3D, 2D, and ML were the top three asset repository types requested
*   License examples:
    *   Smithsonian Open Access (view only but CCO)
    *   Data.world (data science data sets)
    *   ASWF logos 
    *   Research oriented:  [https://developer.nvidia.com/orca](https://developer.nvidia.com/orca) ;  [https://casual-effects.com/data/](https://casual-effects.com/data/) .
        *   These datasets are static (no animation, rigs etc)
    *   [http://videomatting.com/](http://videomatting.com/) 
*   Licenses: Unmodified licenses are easier. As few as possible … ideally 2.
*   Quality levels: Could have badging / tagging (Testing Only, Stress Test, Production Asset, etc).  Production cruftiness; clean and portable; reference asset
*   Taxonomy badges (Material, mesh, image, etc)

Goals and Non Goals



*   Scope: Small set of exemplars.  Quality over quantity.
*   One asset per ASWF project?  A good place to start, but leaves out many other purposes.
*   Describe the MVP Minimum Viable Product.
*   Could pick a Blender film as a starting point, and ask each project, does this work for you? Draw out specific lacking features, scale, etc. 
    *   Are there enough AOVs to make them interesting OpenEXR files?
    *   Modernize OpenEXR Image lib. Have cameras, but what is most needed? Best to have specific demand.
    *   Stress cases - abusing the format - can come from production or from project.
*   Level of goals: rather than “these exact outcomes”, look for value we want to deliver: “serve needs of our projects” or etc.
*   To turn “maybes” to “yeses” for studio participation: Establish selfish goals.  Such as help this ASWF project you use.
*   These could be on-boarding / mentoring / diversity projects.
    *   Students could be a great help. Under direction of experienced studio person.
*   ASWF uniquely positioned to raise ideas in research community:  identify important new use cases, etc.
*   Remove licensing hurdle, hosting hurdle.  Make it viable for a studio to donate.
*   Identify or develop assets. But also maintain over time.
    *   A snapshot in time is easier than maintaining over time. Keep it easy. 
    *   PRMan tests vs USD backlot:  Freezing assets for testing over time versus updating formats to reflect current best-practice.
    *   ABC and PBR shaders → Python script → USD files.  Wave changes the script periodically; source material constant, USD format evolves.

Next Steps and Meeting Cadence



*   Michael B Johnson steps forward to chair - Thank you!
*   Meetings @ 2 weeks, same time slot.
*   Homework: Look around your company for potential assets, let’s pool the list, see what’s rare or missing, etc.
*   Working Group mission right now: Create proposal(s), what should ASWF be doing about assets. We can boil the ocean later. :-)
